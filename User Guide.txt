- This website is hosted on the free "000webhost" cloud server. The SQL database is also being hosted from there.

- The database is being hosted by the MySQL administration tool named "phpMyAdmin" and can only be accessed by my own username and password.




- To host the website on another server, the website URL and the Admin Control URL will naturally change

- Then the connection to the database needs to be changed as well on the "constant.php" file. The new website URL, new username and passwords for 
the "phpMyAdmin" tool and the new database name needs to be used, in place of all the current fields.
